This is an **experimental library** in which I create in order to take a dive into HTML5 Canvas. Along the way, I'm also aiming at learning how to build a modular library.

Once again, this is **experimental**. Meaning, I don't recommend anyone to use this in production. There are other, and definitely better, canvas libraries, such as [FabricJs](http://fabricjs.com/).

## Target

1. Modular (I've chosen AMD style with the help of RequireJS)
2. Learning how to create better API.
3. Unit tested (I'm using phantomjs and jasmine)
4. Animations
5. Physics Animations
6. Learning performance

## Testing

Make sure you have [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/) installed. Also, please install the components needed by this library:

> $ bower install

And then, to run the test, just run:

> $ make test
