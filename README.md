# Kanfas Crazy Balls

This is just a simple bouncing balls animation based on kanfas. [Kanfas](github.com/keripix/kanfas) is an experimental HTML5 Canvas library that I made in order to play around with Canvas.

This experiment uses 2 canvas layer. The background layer is used to draw the static yellow balls. Meanwhile, the foreground layer is used to render the moving balls.
