# Kanfas

This is a learning project aiming at understanding HTML5 Canvas. The libraries included here are all experimental.

Another target for this project is learning how to develop modular components, so that the final application is composed from these components. Each components should be focused on its responsibility.

Last, but not least, all of the components should be unit tested.

## What's not in here

1. Better cross browser support. Right now that's not a priority for me. But I'm hoping to dig into that area soon.
2. Performance. Well performance is good. But right now I'm more focused on making the code works correctly.

## Examples

Examples which have been built during this project can be seen inside the `examples` directory.
