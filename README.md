# KANFAS

Kanfas is a learning project to understand the inside of HTML5 Canvas and its performance.

This is also an attempt on building modular javascript libraries.

### WARNING

I **DISCOURAGE** you to use Kanfas in production use. There are a lot of great canvas libraries out there:

+ [FabricJs](http://fabricjs.com/)
+ [KineticJs](http://kineticjs.com/)
+ And others.

Pleas use those libraries.
